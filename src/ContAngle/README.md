# ContactAngle-Curvature-Roughness

Automatic measurements of contact angle, interfacial curvature and surface roughness in pore-scale 3D-images

## Summary

This document presents the implementation of codes and scripts and the instructions for using them to run the automatic measurements of contact angle, fluid/fluid interface curvature and solid surface roughness applied on segmented 3D pore-space images. This package, when installed, performs surface extraction between contact phases, smoothing the extracted surface, measuring the distributions of contact angle, fluid/fluid interface curvature and solid roughness.

In the following, this document is organized into three sections. First is **Installation**, where the user can understand how to install and compile the code on his workstation. Next is **Usage**, where the user is guided how prepare his input data, run the code to analyze his input data and visualize the final results. Finally is **Citations**, here the user is refereed for publications related to this work for more additional details.


# Installation

For build instruction, see [../../script/README.md](https://github.com/aliraeini/ContactAngle/blob/master/src/script/README.md).

Note: Not all OpenFOAM codes support the surface zones required by this code and can not be used instead of the foamx3m provided in the thirdparty folder.


# Usage

Prepare your image as in the tutorial folder ( a .mhd header file and the image data in .raw or .raw.gz or .tif or .am format).  Then run, in the same folder:

```  {.bash language="bash"}
PATH/TO/src/ContAngle/AllRunContAngle  IMAGE.mhd
``` 
If the `IMAGE.mhd` argument is not provided, the script will run for all the `.mhd` files located in the working directory of your terminal.  If a system folder is available in current directory of the terminal, it will be used, otherwise the the system folder is copied from the one in tutorial folder.   Therefore, if you want to modify the code settings, you can copy the system folder from the tutorial folder to current directory: `cp PATH/TO/src/ContactAngle/tutorial/system .`

Do not run the script directly from the tutorial nor the src folder, run it from a clean folder to avoid overwriting files.

Mind the fact that this is a research code. You need to know what the code is doing and set the parameters correctly to get optimum results: 

- Monitor the output of the code and set the number of smoothing iteration to a value that the code does not diverge.  This is done through adjusting the `nIterationsCurvature1` and `nIterationsCurvature` in the system folder.   The reported values for face areas (`A`), curvature (`k`) and displacements (`DispMag`) should not diverge as the code applies the curvature smoothing iterations.

- The micro-CT image should have a high resolution and the resolution should be roughly the same as the voxel size.  In some cases, you may need to coarsen the image by a factor of two to achieve this.  This can be done by adding a keyword `resampleMode 2` in a new line at the end of the .mhd file (this coarsens the image assigning to each voxel the mode value of the smaller voxels. It works for this code which uses libvoxel, not the [original] version which uses an old voxelImage library for reading the image).  
FYI: Resolution is the effective size of small features being resolved, which is at least (larger than) the width of the transition region between phases in the gray-scale image (ignoring the salt and pepper noise).   So having a coarser image but with the same resolution is preferred since the micro-CT gray-scale images are often not so sharp and since this code ability to converge toward a uniform curvature is somewhat a function of voxel size (and the relative roughness of the solid wall) at the moment.

This code applies a set of slightly different (limited) filters before extracting the surfaces (mode instead of median) and can have slightly different behaviour, but the difference should be negligible.  These filters are meant to filter out problematic voxels and have a very small effect on the over smoothness of the surfaces extracted. Additional filters can be applied, for example, through the use of modeFilter keyword in the input .mhd file to remove  image noise artefacts, but excessive filtering can introduce more artefacts than it suppresses.

**The following notes are relevant only if you do not want to use the AllRunContAngle script mentioned above, or want to revise the input parameters**


## Input data format 


The following required input files are provided in `docs/Example`:

1.  Segmented dataset from 3D multiphase images (i.e. Micro-CT) should be given in ascii (suffix should be `.dat`)
    or binary files (better to have `.raw` or .raw.gz or .am suffix, the data should be in
    8bit unsigned char). For contact angle and oil/brine interface curvature - the voxel values of the segmented phases should be: oil = 2, rock (solid) = 1 and brine = 0. The contact angle is measured through the brine phase (voxel value = 0). An example is provided in `tutorial/subvolume` folder, which is a binary segmented image cropped from Sample-1 image available on Digital Rocks Portal website:
<https://www.digitalrocksportal.org/projects/151> and compressed in .gz format. 

For measuring roughness - it is required to be applied on dry images (contain solid phase only). The voxel values of the segmented dry image should be solid = 1 and brine (or air) = 0.  THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED IN THIS FORKED REPOSITORY, YOU MAY NEED TO CHECK OUT THE [ORIGINAL] REPOSITORY.


2.  A sub-directory called `system` to comply with the basic directory structure for an OpenFOAM case. Make sure that there are two files (`controlDict` file and `meshingDict` file) in the system folder that contain the setting parameters.
Note: the `controlDict` file is where run control parameters are set including start/end time. The `meshingDict` file is where the input and output files in each step of the algorithm is specified.



## Manually running the contact angle and fluid/fluid interface curvature codes

Open a terminal and type the following to run the code:

```  {.bash language="bash"}
voxelToSurfaceML 
surfaceAddLayerToCL 
calcContactAngleUnifKc 
cat contactAngles.txt >> Kc.txt 
cat Kc.txt >> *_Layered_Smooth.vtk
``` 

This command will execute the following:

1.  Extract the surface (multi-zone mesh _M_).
Note: Mesh _M_ is divided into three face-zones: **z**<sub>1</sub> represents the oil/rock interface, **z**<sub>2</sub> is the oil/brine interface and **z**<sub>3</sub> is the brine/rock interface in an oil-brine system. All vertices are given a label i. The set of vertices that belong to each zone will be denoted as _V_<sub>_OR_</sub>, _V_<sub>_OB_</sub> and _V_<sub>_BR_</sub> respectively. _V_<sub>_CL_</sub> is the set of vertices which are shared by all three face-zones representing the three-phase contact line. The name of the output file here (\*.vtk) is specified.

2. Add a “layer” near the three-phase contact line.
Note: Here the extracted file from the previous step is used as an input file (\*.vtk) and the name of the output file (\*\_Layered.vtk) is specified. Each vertex in the contact line set (i ∈ _V_<sub>_CL_</sub>) is constrained to have a single edge connection with an adjacent vertex of each zone.

3. Smooth the surface and curvature measurement.
Note: In this step, the output file from the previous step (\*\_Layered.vtk) is used as an input mesh to apply the smoothing algorithm. The name of the smoothed output file (\*\_Layered\_Smooth.vtk) is specified. In this step, a volume-preserving Gaussian smoothing is applied on mesh _M_, and then a volume-preserving curvature uniform smoothing is applied, which is consistent with capillary equilibrium. Two output files (Kc_x.txt and Kc.txt) are specified. The file Kc_x.txt contains the curvature values of the vertices belonging to the oil/brine interface (_i_ ∈ _V_<sub>_OB_</sub>) and their spatial location coordinates.

4. Contact angle measurement.
Note: The contact angle is computed on each vertex that belongs to the contact line set, i ∈ _V_<sub>_CL_</sub>. The contact angle (\theta <sub>_i_</sub>)for each vertex is calculated through the brine phase by:     
<!-- \theta_i = \pi- \acos (\textbf{n}_i|_{\textbf{z}_2}\cdot\textbf{n}_i|_{\textbf{z}_3}),   i \in V_{CL} -->       
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\theta_i=\pi-\cos^{-1}(\textbf{n}_i|_{\textbf{z}_2}\cdot\textbf{n}_i|_{\textbf{z}_3}),~~~~i\in{V_{CL}}" border="0"/>     

The normal vectors are computed on the vertices comprising the contact line, i ∈ _V_<sub>_CL_</sub>. Each vertex is represented with two vectors normal to the oil/brine interface (**z**<sub>2</sub>) and the brine/rock interface (**z**<sub>3</sub>), as shown in abstract figure.

## Running the surface roughness code

Open a terminal and type the following to run the code:

```  {.bash language="bash"}
voxelToSurfaceML && surfaceRoughness && more Ra.txt >> *_Smooth_Roughness.vtk

``` 

This command will execute the following:

1.  Extract the surface (single-zone mesh _S_).
Note: Mesh _S_ is a single face-zone mesh that represents the rock surface only. For best results, it is better to apply this code on dry images (contain solid phase only).

## Visualization
The generated files: surface (\*.vtk), layered surface (\*\_Layered.vtk) and smoothed surfcae (\*\_Layered\_Smooth.vtk). These files can be visualized using three-dimensional image visualization software (in this work Paraview software was used), as demonstrated in the abstract figure.
